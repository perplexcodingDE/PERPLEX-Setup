# "PERPLEX-Setup"

The "PERPLEX-Setup" is a an (basic) Web Development-Setup for Front-End (Web) Developer.
It's easy to install an the only thing you need is an SCSS-Compiler - I prefer the integrated
one from JetBrains!


## Installation

You doesn't need to install external programms like npm (Node Packet Manager) or something else.
You can easily follow the steps below: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/perplexcodingDE/PERPLEX-Setup.git
```

otherwise you can just press the "Use this template" button.
